---

# DELIVERABLES & GIT/GITHUB RULES (strict)

* **Minimum commits during January:** 12 meaningful commits (≥3 per week).
* **Required folders:** `1.January/`, `notes/January/`, `exercises/c/`, `exercises/pointers/`, `linux/`, `arch/`.
* **Final PR (by 31 Jan 23:59):** include:

  * `README-jan.md` summarizing what was achieved
  * Links to sample outputs (valgrind report, gdb log, objdump output)
  * `january.md` updated (tick boxes only after Progress Evaluator gives green signal)

---

# WHEN TO PING THE CHATS (exact schedule)

* **Strategy AI (this chat):**

  * On Jan 1 (done), Jan 15 (mid-month check), Jan 31 (month review + adjust Feb).
  * Prompt: `Mid-month check: I'm on week 2; here's my commits and energy update: ... Adjust plan.`

* **Curriculum Master (topic breakdown only):**

  * On **Jan 1**, paste the list below (the user will paste the topics block provided further down) to receive detailed subtopic checklists for each item.
  * Also use before Week 2 (for pointers/memory) and Week 4 (assembly & caches) to get deeper subtopics.

* **Progress Evaluator:**

  * Weekly on Sundays (Jan 3, 10, 17, 24, 31) paste that week’s notes+commits.
  * At final (Jan 31) paste the full month deliverables to request approval for ticking month items.
  * Example usage:

    ```
    Here are my commits and notes for week 2: <list of commit links>. Evaluate what I covered, missed, and what to revise.
    ```

# STEALTH TAGGING (summary of items safe to do at office)

All items previously marked with `[stealth]` may be read/edited at work in PDF, terminal, or markdown form. For quick reference, these are the stealth items this month:

* Git & GitHub reading and config (`[stealth]`)
* Linux Essentials (`[stealth]`)
* Valgrind/gdb usage (`[stealth]`)
* NVMe/Spec reading if needed (`[stealth]`) — (not in January main list, but allowed)
* Architecture diagrams and short notes (`[stealth]`)

When doing stealth at work, prefer terminal editors, PDFs, or markdown files that resemble internal docs.

---

# FINAL ADVICE FOR JANUARY

* Keep commits small and descriptive.
* Make `README-jan.md` the single source of truth for month’s status.
* Every Sunday night, paste progress to Progress Evaluator.
* If energy collapses mid-month, message Strategy AI for an adjustment — do not skip check-ins.
