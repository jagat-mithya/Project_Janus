# Project_Janus

- **Meaning:** Named after Janus, the Roman god of **beginnings, gates, and transitions**.
- **The Depth:** Janus is depicted with **two faces**—one looking into the past, one into the future.
- **Why it fits:** One face looks at **Hardware** (the foundation, the past), and the other looks at **Software** (the user experience, the future). You are the gatekeeper who sees both.
